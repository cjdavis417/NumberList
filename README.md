***This is a program where every time you enter a number it adds that number to a list and 
***returns the sum, the largest number, the smallest number, the average, and the number of 
*** even numbers.Stop the program when a 'X' is entered.

// Goal 1) Don't forget to test the input for the other non-digits and give a meaningful error message. 
// Goal 2) Allow only integers at first but see what changes when you allow real numbers.
